# Enhanced Ping Pong Game

This is an enhanced version of the classic Ping Pong game, implemented in Python using the `turtle` module. It features a unique twist with dynamic paddle and ball interactions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Ball Speed**: The ball's speed increases when hit by a "powered-up" paddle, creating a challenging gameplay experience.
- **Paddle Power-Up**: Every time a player scores a multiple of 10 points, their paddle turns red for 10 seconds. During this time, any ball hit by the red paddle moves faster.
- **Pause Functionality**: Players can pause and resume the game by pressing the 'p' key.

## How to Play

- Use the 'w' and 's' keys to move the left paddle up and down.
- Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.
- Press 'p' to pause and resume the game.

## Installation

2. Clone this repository or download the game file.
